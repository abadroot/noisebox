noisebox - a synth for the raspberry pi (and Akai LPD8)

This should work with the debian squeeze distro for raspberry pi.

the only thing you need to install is libasound2-dev, which you can do by typing 

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

into your raspberry pi's terminal.


to make it, cd into the folder, and type "make"

Let me know if there's any problems!
